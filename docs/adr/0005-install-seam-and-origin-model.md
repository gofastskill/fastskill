# ADR-0005 — Install/update/reindex live in core; one `Origin` model

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-07-08
**Supersedes/relates:** [ADR-0003](0003-serve-trust-boundary-and-edge-auth.md) (WRITE-GATE), [ADR-0004](0004-bare-version-is-exact.md) (bare version = exact pin, registry-scoped), [ADR-0002](0002-conditional-semantic-indexing.md) (reindex conditional on an Embedding provider). Motivated by [spec 003](../../specs/003-browser-skill-management.md).

## Context

`fastskill serve` ships a bundled web UI. To let a local user *manage* skills from the browser (install from a source, update, remove), the HTTP handlers need to run the same install/update/reindex work the CLI does. Two facts, surfaced while auditing the codebase (PR #201), make this non-trivial:

1. **The orchestration lives in the CLI crate.** `execute_add` (install), the update apply path, and `execute_reindex` are in `fastskill-cli`. An HTTP handler in `fastskill-core` cannot call *up* into the CLI crate. The `reindex` handler already returns `501` for exactly this reason, and the `upgrade` handler *shells out* to the `fastskill` binary — a request-body-to-subprocess path we do not want (against the SEC-2 hardening direction).

2. **"Where a skill comes from" is modelled four different ways.** There are two distinct types both named `SkillSource` (one in `core::manifest`, one in the CLI `add` command), plus `SourceType`, plus nine flat `source_*` fields on `SkillDefinition` (`source_url`, `source_type`, `source_branch`, `source_tag`, `source_subdir`, `installed_from`, `commit_hash`, `fetched_at`, `editable`). The glossary (CONTEXT.md) additionally **bans "source"** as a concept (it is a deprecated command alias folded into `repos`) and reserves **Repository** for a *configured* place skills are fetched from.

We must decide (a) how the browser write-handlers obtain install/update/reindex capability, and (b) what the canonical vocabulary/type for a skill's provenance is.

## Decision

### 1. The domain logic moves into `fastskill-core`; the CLI becomes a thin caller

Introduce core service methods on `FastSkillService`:

- `install(origin, mode)` where `mode ∈ {Fresh, Update}` — resolve the `Origin` → fetch → validate → write skills dir → update Manifest + Lock → reindex-if-provider. **Install and update are one operation**, differing only in policy (see below).
- a **core reindex seam** — reindex is domain logic (skills dir → Vector index) and belongs in core.

Both the HTTP handlers **and** the CLI verbs (`execute_add`/`execute_update`/`execute_reindex`) call these methods. The CLI commands become thin wrappers (arg parsing + human output) over the shared core path.

The genuinely CLI-flavoured concerns are **construction-time dependencies, not logic**, and are supplied at `serve`/CLI startup:

- **Embedding provider** — reading the API key from env/config happens at startup (in the CLI, where config resolution belongs); the constructed provider (already a core abstraction, `OpenAIEmbeddingService`) is handed to the service. Reindex then runs iff a provider is present, else **skips silently** (ADR-0002).
- **Progress reporting** — a UI concern. The HTTP path returns a structured `Result`; it does not need live progress. The CLI keeps its progress output in its wrapper.

`UpdateService` is **retained but narrowed** to what it already is: the read-only *"is anything newer?"* query (`check_updates`/`resolve_updates`) that backs `check`/`--dry-run`. The *apply* half is `install(origin, Update)`.

**Rejected — dependency-inversion / trait injection (core defines `SkillInstaller`/`Reindexer` traits, CLI implements and injects them):** this keeps the orchestration physically in the CLI and adds an indirection layer, but the logic (resolve → fetch → write → lock → reindex) is domain logic that has no reason to live in the CLI. Injection is warranted for the *dependencies* (the embedding provider), not for the *logic*. We inject the provider; we move the logic.

**Rejected — keep shelling out:** re-introduces the request-body → `Command::new` subprocess surface (SEC-2), and cannot return structured results.

**Rejected — leave the CLI on its own separate install path, add a parallel core method only for HTTP:** ships *two* install orchestrations guaranteed to drift. The whole point is one path.

### 2. One canonical `Origin` type replaces the four provenance models

**`Origin`** (in `fastskill-core`) is *where a single installed skill came from* — serving both the **input** to an install and the **provenance** recorded on the installed skill (one type, one truth). Variants:

| Variant | Fields | Versioning |
|---|---|---|
| `git` | `url`, ref (`branch`\|`tag`\|`commit`), `subdir?` | ref-based, versionless |
| `local` | `path`, `editable` | ref-based, versionless |
| `zip-url` | `url` | ref-based, versionless |
| `repository` | `repo`, `skill`, `version: Option<Version>` | **the only variant ADR-0004 governs** |

- `Origin` **replaces** `core::manifest::SkillSource`, the CLI `SkillSource`, `SourceType`, and the nine flat `SkillDefinition.source_*` fields (which become a single `origin: Origin`).
- `Origin::repository` is a *reference into* a configured **Repository** — the two are kept distinct (a typed-in GitHub URL is an `Origin::git`, **not** a `git-marketplace` Repository).
- The persisted manifest/lock serde representation changes outright (`"source"` → `"repository"`, flat fields → nested `origin`). This is a **greenfield break with no back-compat shim** — consistent with the project's break-for-better-design stance.

## Consequences

- The browser install/update flow works in-process with no subprocess and no fake `200`s; reindex is reachable from core (runs or skips-silently per provider state).
- `install`/`update`/`reindex` have exactly one implementation each, shared by CLI and HTTP — the four-enum drift and the two-`SkillSource` name collision are deleted, not layered over.
- **Migration:** on-disk manifests/locks written by older builds are not readable after the `Origin` format change. Acceptable at current maturity (greenfield); flagged here so it is a conscious break.
- Identity is unchanged (a skill's `id` is derived from its own `SKILL.md`); install is fetch-then-`409`-on-existing-id, with the existing skill's `Origin` surfaced so a provenance change is a deliberate Update, never a silent overwrite.
- `FastSkillService` now carries an optional embedding provider; the `serve` binary must construct and pass it (or `None`).
