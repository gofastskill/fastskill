# FastSkill Cheatsheet

Quick reference for common FastSkill operations.

## Installation

| Operation | Command | What It Does |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Public registry | `fastskill add pptx` | Installs skill from configured registry, clones to `.claude/skills/`, updates `skill-project.toml` and `skills.lock` |
| With version | `fastskill add pptx@1.2.3` | Installs specific version from registry, pins exact version in lock file |
| Private registry | `fastskill add team-skill` | Installs from private registry (auth configured in `skill-project.toml`), uses env var for authentication |
| Git repo | `fastskill add https://github.com/org/skill.git` | Git URL is the source (no package name needed), clones repository, validates skill structure, registers and installs to skills directory |
| Network share | `fastskill add \\\\fileserver\\corp-skills\\team-tools` | Installs from corporate network file share, copies skill to local skills directory, enables team-wide skill distribution |
| Editable install | `fastskill add ./dev-skill -e` | Creates symlink/reference to local path, changes reflect immediately without reinstall |
| Folder of skills | `fastskill add ./skills -r` | Adds all skills under directory (each dir with SKILL.md); only for local directory |
| Read skill | `fastskill read my-skill-id` | Retrieves skill documentation and base directory path in agent-optimized format |
| List installed | `fastskill list` | Lists locally installed skills with reconciliation status (grid format) |
| List installed (JSON) | `fastskill list --json` | Lists locally installed skills in JSON format with reconciliation status |
| Remove skill | `fastskill remove my-skill-id` | Removes skill from skills directory, updates `skill-project.toml` and `skills.lock`, prompts for confirmation |
| Force remove | `fastskill remove my-skill-id --force` | Removes skill without confirmation prompt |
| Show all skills | `fastskill show` | Lists all installed skills with versions from lock file |
| Show skill details | `fastskill show my-skill-id` | Displays detailed information about specific skill (ID, version, description, source) |
| Show dependency tree | `fastskill show --tree` | Displays dependency relationships between installed skills |

## Skill Authoring

| Operation | Command | What It Does |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Initialize metadata | `fastskill init` | Extracts metadata from `SKILL.md` frontmatter, prompts for missing fields, creates `skill-project.toml` |
| With version | `fastskill init --version 1.2.3` | Creates `skill-project.toml` with specified version, skips version prompt |
| Non-interactive | `fastskill init --yes` | Uses defaults from `SKILL.md`, creates `skill-project.toml` without prompts |
| Package skill | `fastskill package --output ./artifacts` | Packages skill into ZIP artifact with version from `skill-project.toml`, creates checksums and metadata |
| Auto-detect changes | `fastskill package --detect-changes --auto-bump` | Detects changed skills using file hashes, auto-bumps version, packages only changed skills |
| Package specific | `fastskill package --skills web-scraper data-processor` | Packages only specified skills into ZIP artifacts |

## Sync

| Operation | Command | What It Does |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Sync all skills | `fastskill sync --yes` | Syncs all installed skills to the auto-detected metadata file (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, or GEMINI.md) |
| Sync with agent | `fastskill sync --agent claude --yes` | Syncs to the metadata file for the specified agent (e.g. CLAUDE.md for `claude`) |
| Sync with override | `fastskill sync --agents-file custom.md --yes` | Syncs to a custom metadata file path, overriding auto-detection |
| Interactive sync | `fastskill sync` | Interactively select which skills to expose in the detected metadata file |

## Servers

| Operation | Command | What It Does |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Web UI | `fastskill serve --enable-registry` | Starts HTTP server with REST API and web UI at `/registry` for browsing installed skills |
| API server | `fastskill serve` | Starts HTTP server with REST API only (no web UI), exposes endpoints for programmatic access |

## Admin

| Operation | Command | What It Does |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| List repositories | `fastskill sources list` | Lists all configured repositories from `skill-project.toml` |
| Show repository | `fastskill sources show repo-name` | Displays repository configuration details (type, URL, auth, priority) |
| Add repository | `fastskill sources add repo-name --repo-type git-marketplace <url>` | Adds new repository to `skill-project.toml`, supports git-marketplace, http-registry, zip-url, local |
| Remove repository | `fastskill sources remove repo-name` | Removes repository from `skill-project.toml` |
| Update repository | `fastskill sources update repo-name --branch main --priority 1` | Updates repository metadata (branch, priority) |
| Test repository | `fastskill sources test repo-name` | Tests repository connectivity and accessibility |
| Refresh repositories | `fastskill sources refresh` | Refreshes repository cache (re-fetches from source) |
| List registry skills | `fastskill registry list-skills` | Lists all skills from HTTP registry (grid format) |
| List registry skills (JSON) | `fastskill registry list-skills --json` | Lists all skills from HTTP registry in JSON format |
| List by scope | `fastskill registry list-skills --scope acme` | Lists skills filtered by scope from HTTP registry |
| List all versions | `fastskill registry list-skills --all-versions` | Lists all versions of each skill from HTTP registry |
| Show skill | `fastskill registry show-skill skill-id` | Shows details for a specific skill from registry |
| Show skill versions | `fastskill registry versions skill-id` | Lists all available versions for a specific skill |
| Search skills | `fastskill registry search query` | Searches for skills across repositories (text-only search) |
