## What is FastSkill?

FastSkill is a **high-performance Rust service layer** that enables AI agents and agent frameworks to discover, load, and execute skills directly. It provides comprehensive services that agents integrate with to access skill functionality without requiring a tool calling layer.

<Info>
FastSkill is built with Rust for maximum performance, memory safety, and reliability. The service layer provides async/await support via tokio and can be used as a library or through the CLI.

  </Card>

  <Card title="Cursor Integration" icon="code">
    Automatically generate skill registries for Cursor IDE integration and AI agent tool discovery.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Progressive Loading" icon="zap">
    Load skill metadata first, then content on demand for optimal performance and memory usage.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Keyword Search" icon="file-text">
    Traditional text-based search for reliable, predictable skill discovery.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Multiple Output Formats" icon="table">
    Export results as tables, JSON, or XML for different integration needs.
  </Card>

## Quick Start

Get up and running with FastSkill in under 5 minutes:

```rust
use fastskill::{FastSkillService, ServiceConfig};
use std::path::PathBuf;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create service with default configuration
    let config = ServiceConfig {
        skill_storage_path: PathBuf::from("./skills"),
        ..Default::default()
    };

    let service = FastSkillService::new(config).await?;
    service.initialize().await?;

    // List available skills
    let skills = service.skill_manager().list_skills(None).await?;
    println!("Found {} skills", skills.len());

    // Discover relevant skills using semantic search
    let relevant_skills = service.metadata_service()
        .discover_skills("extract text from PDF")
        .await?;

    println!("Found {} relevant skills", relevant_skills.len());

    Ok(())
}
```

## Architecture Overview

FastSkill follows a modular Rust architecture designed for scalability and performance:

### Core Components

- **CLI Tool**: Rust-based command-line interface for indexing and searching skills
- **Vector Index**: SQLite-based storage for skill embeddings and metadata
- **Embedding Service**: OpenAI integration for semantic text vectorization
- **Search Engine**: Hybrid search supporting both semantic and keyword matching
- **Markdown Export**: Automatic generation of Cursor-compatible skill registries
- **Rust Library**: High-performance API for programmatic skill management with async/await support

## Use Cases

FastSkill is perfect for:

- **AI Agent Development**: Enable agents to discover and use skills through direct service integration
- **Service Integration**: Provide comprehensive services that agents can use directly
- **Skill Marketplaces**: Build platforms where users can share and consume skills
- **Enterprise Integration**: Standardize skill access across different agent frameworks
- **Development Workflows**: Hot reload skills during development without service restart
