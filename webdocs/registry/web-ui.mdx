# Registry Web UI

The FastSkill Registry Web UI provides a user-friendly interface for browsing, searching, and managing skills from configured sources.

## Accessing the UI

Start the server with the registry enabled:

```bash
fastskill serve --enable-registry
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080/registry` in your browser.

## Features

### Source Navigation

- **Sidebar**: Browse skills by source
- **Source filter**: Filter skills by source in the dropdown
- **Source counts**: See how many skills each source provides

### Search and Filter

- **Text search**: Search by name, description, tags, or capabilities
- **Status filter**: Show only installed or available skills
- **Real-time filtering**: Results update as you type

### Skill Cards

Each skill is displayed as a card showing:

- **Name and version**: Primary skill information
- **Description**: What the skill does
- **Tags**: Categorization tags
- **Capabilities**: What the skill can do
- **Installation status**: Installed (green) or Available (blue)
- **Source**: Which source provides the skill
- **Actions**: Install or Uninstall buttons

### Virtual Scrolling

For sources with hundreds of skills, the UI uses virtual scrolling to:

- Only render visible skills
- Maintain smooth performance
- Handle large skill lists efficiently

## Using the UI

2. Skills are automatically loaded from all configured sources
3. Use the sidebar to filter by source
4. Click on a source name to show only skills from that source

### Search Skills

### Uninstall Skills

## API Integration

The UI uses the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/registry/sources` - List all sources
- `GET /api/registry/skills` - Get all skills from all sources
- `GET /api/registry/sources/:name/skills` - Get skills from specific source
- `POST /api/skills` - Install a skill
- `DELETE /api/skills/:id` - Uninstall a skill

## Performance

The UI is optimized for performance:

- **Virtual scrolling**: Only renders visible items
- **Client-side filtering**: Fast search without server round-trips
- **Caching**: Marketplace.json responses are cached
- **Lazy loading**: Skills load as needed

## Browser Support

The UI works in modern browsers:

- Chrome/Edge 90+
