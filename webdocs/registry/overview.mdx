# Registry Overview

The FastSkill Registry provides a web-based interface for browsing, searching, and managing skills from multiple configured sources.

## Features

- **Multi-source browsing**: View skills from all configured sources in one place
- **Search and filter**: Find skills by name, description, tags, or capabilities
- **Installation status**: See which skills are installed and which are available
- **Virtual scrolling**: Efficiently handle repositories with hundreds of skills
- **Real-time updates**: Skills list updates when you install or uninstall

## Enabling the Registry

Start the server with the `--enable-registry` flag:

```bash
fastskill serve --enable-registry
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080/registry` in your browser.

## Architecture

The registry consists of:

1. **REST API**: Backend endpoints for fetching skills and sources
2. **Web UI**: Frontend interface for browsing and managing skills
3. **Marketplace.json**: Standard format for skill discovery from sources

## Sources

Skills can come from multiple sources:

- **Git repositories**: Skills hosted in Git repos with `marketplace.json`
- **Zip URL sources**: Skills distributed via ZIP files with `marketplace.json`
- **Local sources**: Skills in local directories (not supported in registry)

Only sources that provide `marketplace.json` files are displayed in the registry.

## Workflow

1. **Configure repositories**: Add repositories to `[tool.fastskill.repositories]` section in `skill-project.toml`
2. **Generate marketplace.json**: Use `fastskill registry create` to generate marketplace files
3. **Start server**: Run `fastskill serve --enable-registry`
4. **Browse skills**: Open `/registry` in your browser or use `fastskill registry list-skills` to list skills from HTTP registries
5. **List installed skills**: Use `fastskill list` to see locally installed skills with reconciliation status
6. **Install skills**: Click "Install" in the web UI or use `fastskill add` to add skills to your local installation
